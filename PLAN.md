## 13. Risk Management

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Render free-tier DB goes idle / cold-start latency | 🟠 High | 🟠 High | DB retry logic (5 attempts, 3s delay); wake endpoint via cron |
| R2 | Google Gemini API rate limits or downtime | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 High | In-memory cache (5-min TTL); graceful degradation to static suggestions |
| R3 | Cloudflare R2 presigned URL expiry causes broken images | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | 1-hour TTL on URLs; client-side retry on 403; cover redirect endpoint |
| R4 | Large PDF files cause slow streaming/loading | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 High | 10 MB limit; server-side proxy with timeout; progressive loading |
| R5 | JWT token theft / unauthorized access | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Critical | Short-lived access tokens; refresh token rotation; HTTPS-only; Helmet |
| R6 | Scope creep delays launch | 🟠 High | 🟠 High | Strict MVP scope per phase; backlog for future features; weekly reviews |
| R7 | Team member unavailability | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 High | Cross-training; documented code; pair programming sessions |
| R8 | Vercel deployment cold starts | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | ISR for static pages; edge functions for API proxies |
| R9 | Cross-browser PDF rendering issues | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Use proven @react-pdf-viewer library; test on all major browsers |
| R10 | Data loss in PostgreSQL | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Critical | Render managed backups; soft-delete pattern; activity audit trail |

## 14. Dependencies & Blockers

### Critical Path

```
DB Models → Auth → RBAC Middleware → CRUD Endpoints → File Upload → PDF Streaming
    │                                       │
    │                                       ▼
    │                             Dashboard API Integration → Dashboard UI

    │                                       ▼
    │                             Frontend API Integration → Frontend UI
    │
    ▼
AI Endpoints → Vector Search → Frontend AI UI
```

### External Dependencies

| Vercel (hosting) | Both frontends | 🟢 Low | Migrate to Netlify |
| Cloudflare R2 | File storage | 🟢 Low | Migrate to AWS S3 or Supabase Storage |
| Google Gemini API | AI recommendations | 🟡 Medium | OpenAI API fallback; static recommendations |
| Gmail SMTP | Password reset emails | 🟡 Medium | SendGrid or Resend as fallback |
| Vector Search Service | Book cover scan | 🟡 Medium | Disable feature; text-based search only |

### Internal Dependencies

| Task | Blocked By | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard API integration | Backend CRUD endpoints | Cannot build admin features without API |
| Frontend auth pages | Backend auth endpoints | Cannot implement login/register |
| PDF reader | Backend PDF streaming endpoint | Cannot load PDFs without proxy |
| AI frontend features | Backend AI endpoints | Cannot show recommendations |
| File upload UI | Backend upload endpoint + R2 config | Cannot upload books |
| Deployment | All features complete + tested | Cannot launch without verification |
