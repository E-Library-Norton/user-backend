## 🔄 Process

1. **Collect** — Student feedback flows in via the Contact/Feedback form and is visible in the admin dashboard under **Feedback** section
2. **Triage** — Admin reviews new feedback weekly, tags feature requests as `type: feature` and updates status
3. **Prioritize** — Product owner scores each request using MoSCoW + Impact/Effort and adds to this backlog
4. **Schedule** — P0 items are pulled into the next sprint, P1 into the sprint after
5. **Communicate** — When a feature ships, feedback entries that requested it are marked `resolved` with a note
